# My Kerbal Controller

I started this project back in Fall 2019, but it fell to the wayside around when the pandemic started. Now, I intend to finish it!

I plan to include all the code, 3D models, designs, hardware lists, etc. in this repo. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/Kerbal-Controller/issues) if you have a question about something.

If you want some examples of what I'm going for: https://reddit.com/r/KerbalControllers
